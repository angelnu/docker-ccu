# docker-ccu
Homematic CCU firmware running as docker container on arm and (emulated) x86.

This project downloads the Homematic CCU2 firmware and re-package it as docker image. You can then start it on your raspi. Other ARM-based boards might also work (see Dependencies section). You can deploy on x86 but it will be slow and some components fail. I am working on a true multi-arch docker container for this.

An automated build pushes new docker images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/angelnu/ccu/). You can check there the available versions.

Support for CCU2 has been removed from the HEAD. Please checkout the ccu2 branch if you need to build the CCU2 images. There is also another Docker Hub repository with [old CCU2](https://hub.docker.com/r/angelnu/ccu2/) images.

## How to deploy

 1. ssh into the target computer (better an ARM device)
 2. git clone this repository
 3. (Optional) `cp -a settings.template settings` and edit `settings.template`
 4. `sudo ./deploy.sh`
    - you can also use env variables such as `MAYOR_CCU_VERSION=2` to deploy a CCU2 firmware. See [settings.template](settings.template) for all available options

After the above steps you can connect to the <IP address of your computer >:<port 80>. The CCU docker image will be restarted automatically when the computer boots: the container is started in auto-restart mode. With `docker ps ccu` you can see its status.

## Dependencies

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
  - Kubernetes and Docker Swarm can be used for High Availability set ups. See the [cluster section](#cluster) for more details.
- ARM HW. Following combinations tested for both Homematic and Homematic IP:
  - Raspberry with HM-MOD-RPI-PCB
  - Orange Pi Plus 2 with HM-MOD-RPI-PCB
  - OdroidXU4 with HM-LGW-O-TW-W-EU and HmIP-RFUSB
- One or more adapters to connect to the Homematic and/or Homematic IP devices
  - Homematic LAN GW for Homematic devices:
    - [HM-LGW-O-TW-W-EU](https://www.elv.de/homematic-funk-lan-gateway.html)
    - [RaspberryMatic in LAN GW mode](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic#cake-exclusive-features-not-available-in-ccu2ccu3-firmware)
    - Docker computer and LAN GW need to be in the same network. No additional SW is needed in the docker computer. Connection is configured using the CCU web UI (settings -> LAN Gateway configuration)
  - Homematic USB IP adapter
    - [HmIP-RFUSB](https://www.elv.de/elv-homematic-ip-rf-usb-stick-hmip-rfusb-fuer-alternative-steuerungsplattformen-arr-bausatz.html)
    - the required kernel module is `cp210x` which is available in most Linux systems. The `deploy.sh` will add a udev rule to enable it automatically when plugged.
  - HM-MOD-RPI-PCB, RPI-RF-MOD, HB-RF-USB and emulated adapters
    - additional packages need to be installed in the host to support Homematic and Homematic IP in parallel. The required packages come from the [piVCCU project](https://github.com/alexreinert/piVCCU) which supports multiple [ARM devices](https://github.com/alexreinert/piVCCU#prequisites)
    - the `deploy.sh` script will try to install the _pivccu_ packages for you. If it does not work please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/alexreinert/piVCCU#manual-installation) to install `pivccu-modules-dkms`, `pivccu-devicetree-armbian` (if you are on Armbian) and `pivccu-modules-raspberrypi` (if you use a Raspberry with Raspbian). You do not need to install a network bridge since docker manages that.


## What is left
- support for Homematic IP with a single device
  - special kernel modules are needed to duplicate which cannot be loaded into a docker container
  - using the [HmIP-RFUSB](https://www.elv.de/elv-homematic-ip-rf-usb-stick-hmip-rfusb-fuer-alternative-steuerungsplattformen-arr-bausatz.html) should work but not tested yet.
  - looking at [USB adapter](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=47691)
- create true multiarch dynamic docker
  - current multiarch is based on qemu
  - will use OCCU as base as done by this other [project](https://github.com/litti/dccu2)
- automatically build new docker containers when new CCU versions are published by e3q.

## How to build
This is only needed if you do not use the already built docker container.

1. git clone this repository
2. (Optional) `cp -a settings.template settings` and edit `settings.template`
3. `sudo ./build.sh`

## How to update to a new CCU firmware

1. `./pull.sh `
2. `./deploy.sh`

Optionally you can use the _CCU_VERSION_ variable to select a particular version.

Your CCU settings will be preserved.

## How to configure local antenna
If you have added a [homematic radio module](http://www.elv.de/homematic-funkmodul-fuer-raspberry-pi-bausatz.html) to your raspberry, then you can use it with your CCU2 docker image. If not, you would need to use the external LAN gateway. You can also use a combination of both.

### Instructions
1. (raspberry 3) You need to avoid that the bluetooth module uses the HW UART. You can either disable it or let it use the miniUART. I use the second option but since I do not use Bluetooth on the Raspi I do not know if this breaks it. More info [here](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/45570/how-do-i-make-serial-work-on-the-raspberry-pi3).
   * Add `dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt`to _/boot/config.txt_
2. (raspberry) Make sure that the serial console is not using the UART
   * Replace `console=ttyAMA0,115200` with `console=tty1` in _/boot/cmdline.txt_
   * More info [here](http://raspberrypihobbyist.blogspot.de/2012/08/raspberry-pi-serial-port.html)
4. Run again `./deploy.sh`

## How to import settings from an existing CCU

### Using the CCU UI (recommend)
1. log into you HW CCU web ui
2. go to Settings -> Security -> create backup
3. go into the the docker CCU web UI
4. go to Settings -> Security -> import backup

### Manually copying files
Please notice that this method does not support switch HW versions: to update from HW CCU2 to docker CCU you need to use the UI

1. Enable ssh in your CCU2. Instructions (in German) [here](https://www.homematic-inside.de/tecbase/homematic/generell/item/zugriff-auf-das-dateisystem-der-ccu-2)
2. ssh into your target computer
3. `sudo ./undeploy.sh`
4. `rsync -av \[your CCU IP\]/usr/local/*  /var/lib/docker/volumes/ccu_data/_data/`
5. `./deploy.sh`

## Cluster

You can deploy this docker container into a docker cluster with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. This allows a High Available configuration where the home automation can stay up in the event of HW dying. This is usefull considering that a Raspberry is cheap so you should not depend on a single one to ensure your house stays warm ;-) .

### Kubernetes
You can check this [example](https://github.com/angelnu/homecloud/blob/master/services/ccu2.yaml) of a high available deployment. There I keep the configuration into a cluster persistent volume (glusterfs) so if one of computers is down then the CCU is "just" redeployed automatically into another available computer.

### Docker swarm
You can also deploy this docker image to a docker swarm. For this you need to:
* set up a docker swarm in multiple Raspberries. They all need to have local antennas at least you use a LAN gateway
* have a shared folder mounted at the same location in all the members of the cluster. Examples:
  * Mount a NAS folder. This is simple but then the NAS is the single point of failure
  * Cluster FS such as glusterfs. TBD: upload instructions

1. Change _settings_ parameters
   * Set _DOCKER_CCU_DATA_ to the absolute path of your shared folder. Example: `_/media/glusterfs/ccu_`
   * Set _DOCKER_MODE_ to `swarm`
   * Set _DOCKER_OPTIONS_ to `--constraint node.labels.architecture==arm`
2. `./deploy.sh`
